Scribble is a **client-side** mod to make editing books easier! It comes with a bunch of quality-of-life features,
allowing you to precisely manage pages in your book, format text using colors and various modifiers, save/load your
books to keep a backup, and much more! And the best thing is, **everyone else on the server can see this, even if they
don't have the mod themselves!**

By default, Scribble intentionally keeps very close to vanilla. It doesn't change any behaviour, but takes the intended
book experience, and just sprinkles some nice-to-haves on top. **Every single feature is configurable**, Scribble gives
you
options when you want it to, and stays out of your way when you need it to.

But there's more! Scribble comes with lots of little features here and there:

- **See two pages at once!** If you're jealous of Bedrock players being able to see two pages at once, you can now also
  toggle this setting in Scribble! This still works seamlessly with every other feature (even lecterns!).
- **Insert or remove pages at any point**, using the extra buttons below the page. No more shuffling around with
  copy-pasting pages.
- **Skip to any page you want!** You can click the page number and type in a page to jump to. Or, hold SHIFT while going
  a page forward and go all the way to the end!
- **Center the book GUI!** Minecraft places the book screen at the very top of your screen, which is inconsistent with
  every other GUI in the game. Scribble fixes that!
- **Edit books with existing color codes easily!** Scribble will seamlessly take over the color codes that are already
  there, and allow you to edit them.
- **Don't lose your progress!** If you're trying to close while you have unsaved work, Scribble will ask if you're sure.
- **Undo or redo any action!** Oops, accidentally deleted something? Don't worry, it's just a single Ctrl-Z away.
