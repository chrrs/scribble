Hi! Thanks for considering contributing to Scribble. Here's some things to keep in mind. For the most part, these are
not hard rules, but suggestions to keep the code manageable.

### LLMs and AI

**Any contributions generated with AI or assisted by AI will not be accepted!** This is inflexible, it's a personal
preference, please respect it.

### Code style

There's not a set list of guidelines to follow here, but try to match the code style to the rest of the code base. This
includes: descriptive variable names, use plenty of whitespace to group related lines together and don't be afraid to
separate out some variables if lines grow too long.

Make sure to use IntelliJ's formatter and import organizer to manage indentation and spacing.

### Reviews

I generally make a lot of comments during PR reviews, please don't take this personally! My end goal is to try and keep
the code base clean and maintainable, as both Minecraft's code base changes in unpredictable ways, and Scribble keeps
growing in features. Keeping the code clean and properly separated helps with this a lot!
